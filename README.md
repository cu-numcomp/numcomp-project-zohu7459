# Individual Project: Numerics in Open Source Software

The goal of this assignment is to investigate how concepts from this class appear in
real-world software.  You can pick any topic that we have covered, will cover, or other
related topic (e.g., from the book).  I highly recommend using [GitHub code
search](https://github.com/search); type a phrase or relevant keywords in and see what
packages show up.  [GitLab explore](https://gitlab.com/explore) is also useful.  Flip
through a few repositories to find one that seems high-quality and relevant (and in a
language you can grok).  Please attempt to find a project that

* has automated testing (look for a badge that says "build passing" or similar)
* has at least 5 committers and/or at least 10 stars.

These criteria are meant to encourage you to find higher quality software.  If you find a
package that seems to be high quality but doesn't satisfy these criteria, that is okay and
won't affect your grade.  This project is supposed to be fun; you'll get full credit if
you make a serious attempt.  Please focus your effort on what you find interesting, not on
trying to check every box in a rubric.

### To complete the assignment:

1. Clone this repository (to your laptop or [Coding CSEL](https://coding.csel.io))
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/cu-numcomp/numcomp-project-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
```
   This creates a new directory.

2. Open the Jupyter notebook [project.ipynb](project.ipynb) and write about the project.
   There are some prompts in the notebook, but feel free to modify as you see fit.

3. Commit your changes in the terminal and push
```
    $ cd numcomp-project-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
    $ git commit -am done
    $ git push
```
